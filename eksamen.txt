# When you render the HTML template and pass data from the server (Python code) to the template, it is calles server side rendering.
 The HTML content is generated on the server side

# Server side is when you pass on data to the template from my python code(server) and client side rendering is almost an empty html. Javascript fetches data from the server. 

Computer storage is a nice analogy: 
Temporary items on a computer are stored in RAM (Random Access Memory), much like sessions,
while permanent items are stored on the hard drive, much like databases.
